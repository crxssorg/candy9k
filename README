candy9k -- a small r9k bot for Discord (and soon Matrix)

We used this bot for our r9k channel. As of now we aren't using it,
but in the meantime I'm going to work on making it interoperable. If you want to
use it you can either use "go run candy9k.go" to compile and run it, or use
"go build candy9k.go" to build it into a binary.

Configuration is simple, just make a file called config.json and use
config.example.json as a template. 

Contributions are welcome.
